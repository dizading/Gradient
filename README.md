# **Bits 1.0**

## *This is a project which I developed it as a part of our Google India Scholarship Challenge 2018 course in Udacity.*

**The gist of the application is about Numbering System, and thus the name *BITS*. This application is design in such a way that it will be accessible for users who do not have any technical background.**

Some features of the application are:
- Introduction on numbering systems
- Introduction on inter-number system conversion
- Quiz on numbering system, inter-number system conversion and digital electronics
- Conversion tab. In this section, the user will specify the number system of the number he wants to convert and the number system he       wants to convert to. Upon finishing the convert button, the user will get his answer.

**Thanks for going through my project** :simple_smile:
